# Security Vulnerability Detection Implementation Plan

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze existing codebase and create implementation plan
- [x] Get user approval for the plan
- [x] Create `utils/security_headers_checker.py` module for HTTP security headers analysis
- [x] Create `utils/web_security_scanner.py` module for additional low-level security checks
- [x] Update `phishing_detector.py` to integrate security header analysis
- [x] Update `main.py` analysis logic to include security checks
- [x] Modify `templates/dashboard.html` to display security header findings and vulnerabilities
- [x] Add new risk categories for security vulnerabilities
- [x] Test the new security checks with sample URLs
- [x] Update risk scoring algorithm to include security vulnerabilities
- [x] Add export functionality for security reports

## Implementation Status: COMPLETE ✅

All security vulnerability detection features have been successfully implemented:

### ✅ Security Headers Analysis

### ✅ Web Security Vulnerability Scanning
- SQL injection pattern detection
- XSS vulnerability scanning
- Directory listing exposure checks
- Sensitive file exposure detection
- Insecure form configurations
- HTTP method security analysis
- Mixed content detection
- Security.txt compliance checking

### ✅ Dashboard Integration
- Security header issues visualization
- Web vulnerability statistics
- Risk level distribution including security findings
- Recent high-risk security issues

### ✅ Export Functionality
- PDF reports for security headers analysis
- PDF reports for web security scans
- Comprehensive security recommendations

### ✅ Risk Scoring Integration
- Security vulnerabilities contribute to overall risk assessment
- Suspicious count includes security findings
- Risk levels: Safe, Low, Medium, High, Critical

The phishing detection tool now provides comprehensive security vulnerability analysis alongside traditional phishing detection capabilities.
